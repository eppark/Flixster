# Project 2 - *Flixster*

**Flixster** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [ ] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code
* [x] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Custom launcher icons
* [x] Heart rating bar to show popularity
* [x] Soft-coded links and stored YouTube keys so as to not waste time/resources to fetch again
* [x] Overlaid YouTube play button that changes when pressed

## Notes

Initial app kept crashing; the error given was "Expected Android API level 21+, but was 30". Changing the Android API level to 29 and the miniSDK level to 21 fixed this issue; perhaps the functionalities used lacked compatibility with API level 30.

## Open-source libraries used
